print ("Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,\n\
  That saved a wretch; like me!\n\
I once was lost, but now am found,\n\
  Was blind, but now I see.\n\
2\n\
’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\n\
  And grace my fears relieved;\n\
How precious did that grace appear\n\
  The hour I first believed!\n\
3\n\
The Lord hath promised good to me,\n\
  His word my hope secures;\n\
He will my shield and portion be\n\
  As long as life endures.\n\
4\n\
When we’ve been there ten thousand years,\n\
  Bright shining as the sun,\n\
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise\n\
  Than when we first begun.")
